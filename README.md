# elo_hub
Home Node Server - Runs on a PI

These are the things I think you need to do:
- Need mqtt server running.. you can test with mosquitto_pub and _sub
- npm install
- typescript
- elo_hub_cfg.json - sample in the repo. mostly mqtt config and paths
- vsts cli installed for the vsts integration stuff
- there are scripts that run. I am keeping mine in ~/.elo  samples are in the script directory
